----------------------
Heed well the words of Mentor, Guardian of Loretome, and I will tell you of times past, of darker days when the empire was saved against all hope. For I fear the darkness is about to return.

The fell legions of Morcar, Lord of Chaos, had swept all before them. At the sight of the Black Banner and the massed hordes of Chaos, even the bravest warriors of the Emperor had turned tail and fled, the land was laid waste and all men despaired.

But then there came a mighty warrior Prince from the Borderlands named Rodgar the Barbarian. He bore a glittering diamond in his brow, the Star of the West, as worn by the ancient kings of legend. Hope returned and men flocked to his standard, leaving their hiding places in the hills and forests.

Other great heroes joined him. Durgin the fearless Dwarven warrior from the Worlds Edge Mountains. Ladril the Elven fighter mage from distant Athelorn and Telor the Wizard whose sorcery was to save Rodgar on many occasions.

For many years Rodgar trained his army, being careful to avoid open battle with Morcar's General until all was ready, but ever harrying their supply lines, wiping out many orcs and goblins.

Then came the day for which Rodgar had waited. His army had grown strong and was well practised. Camping on the high passes, Ladril saw the Black hosts from afar and bade Durgin blow the call to arms on his mighty horn. The armies of Rodgar poured down upon the enemy from two sides, and battle was joined. Many foul creatures and good men perished that day. Yet, as the light of day faded it was Darkness that fled the field. But the victory was not absolute. Morcar and his general escaped beyond the sea of Claws, and even now they plot their revenge.

Soon their plots will be ready and the Empire will have need of a new Rodgar. But where are the heroes to equal him? You have much to learn if you are to become as great as Rodgar and his companions. I will help all I can. This book I carry, Loretome, was written when time began. All that ever was and all that ever will be is recorded in its countless pages.

Through Loretome I may guide you, but I may not intervene, least a greater evil befall the World, and Chaos triumphs forever.

Hero Quest the best selling role-playing game has now been developed into an absorbing fantasy adventure for your computer.

Take up the challenge to become a Hero and enter the underground realm of the evil wizard Morcar. But beware, the unlit tunnels hold many dangers, terrible monsters, deadly traps and mysterious rooms."""

Lemmings are very cute but also very dumb. They will mindlessly walk off cliffs, into water, hazards and traps or they mill around bumping into walls or other obstacles unless you help them get their act together.

You can assist them by giving them certain skills and powers that will help them get through each level of the game. Once you have assigned skills (shown as icons on the bottom of the screen in each level) to certain Lemmings they can use those skills to help them and their fellow Lemmings cope with the dangers that surround them.

Each level of the game is an increasingly difficult environment that the Lemmings must navigate, At each level you have a different number of skills available for assignments, you have different times available for mastering that level and you have varying numbers of Lemmings that you must save to complete that particular level.

A quick brain, the ability to plan ahead and lifetimes dedication to the Save A Lemming Campaign are required to get the right Lemming to perform the right action at the right time. A forgotten blocker, a rogue miner or a misplaced bridge could spell disaster for every Lemming on the screen."""

SpeedBall 2 is played over 2 halves lasting 90 seconds each. Teams swap ends at half time; the action starts when the ball is launched into play in the centre of the pitch. This happens at the beginning of each period, or after a goal, or after a player has been substituted.
The object of the game is to score more points than our opponent - but how you do it is up to you !"""

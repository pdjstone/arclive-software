# Archimedes Live Software Catalogue

A collection of disc images and archive files that can be loaded into [Archimedes Live](https://github.com/pdjstone/archimedes-live). This repository just contains a bunch of [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) files with metadata for each piece of software title. For each title there is either a filename or URL. 

There is also a Python script which downloads or copies each disc image/archive into a single directory and creates a `software.json` file containing all the metadata. This is loaded by Archimedes Live.
